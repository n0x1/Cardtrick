You find yourself trapped in a mysterious manor, where the only way to escape is by defeating opponents in a series of magical card games. But as you battle, you discover a crucial loophole: you can not only play cards, but you can throw and rip them! Throwing deals a stronger effect, but it is removed for the battle. Ripping combines the normal play and thrown effect, but permanently removes the card from your deck. Strategically play, throw, and rip your cards to outwit your opponents and find your way to freedom.
