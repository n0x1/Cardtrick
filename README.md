 You find yourself trapped in a mysterious manor, where the only way to escape is by defeating opponents in a series of magical card games. But as you battle, you discover a crucial loophole: you can not only play cards, but you can throw them right at your enemy or environment! Be careful though, for thrown cards can be lost. Strategically play and throw your cards to outwit your opponents and find your way to freedom.
